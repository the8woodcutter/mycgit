## THE ARMADA CGIT Code Repository
### Chunk's Self Hosted Public Code Repositories - __Members Welcome in the Future__
#### April 2nd 2025

    **NOTICE:**: If a repository does not have a `LICENCE.md` file then that means it is not for sharing!

***

- This project is to `get/put` my cgit files to and from `Debian 12.9` (currently)
- Should _'just work'_

- Yet another COOL web application to customize the styles and the layout :D
  - Ideas if any:
    - Bug Tracker
    - Better libravatar/gravatar support
    - Authentication
    - SSH git R/W synchronization
  - Thing is I'm not actually sure if CGIT already does some of this stuff...

***

### Work In Progress!
